# Runtime Consider philsophy

Runtime Consider reached feature-completeness
This is not abandonment however this is success.

## The Core Principle

Each day in human life is a **real-time operation**.
What happens during that operation can only be recorded **once**.

This app does not try to improve you, motivate you,
or optimize your behavior. It exists only to reflect
what actually happened.

## Why No New Features?

> "If the question is ever 'should we add this to help users?'
> the answer is no. Runtime Consider does not help.
> It reflects. The constraint is the product itself."

The code does what it was designed to do.
Adding features would corrupt the design.

Bug fixes: Yes
Security patches: Yes
New features: No. Forever.

## For Those Who Fork

If you add features, you're building something else.
That's fine. That's open source.

But it's no longer Runtime Consider.
