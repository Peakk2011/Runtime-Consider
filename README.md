## What is this repository

lightweight, high-performance starter kit for TypeScript + Vite + Electron and includes a **ready-to-use folder structure**, **clean architecture**, and **5 core utility files**

## What it does?

- Provides a solid project structure with minimal config.  
- Supplies 5 core utility files for:

  - CSP Handler
  - Fetches and parses a JSON file from a given URL.
  - Application error handler
  - userAgent (This is used to describe your system, what it uses to run things, and more.)
  - IPC Validator
 
## Why?

1. **Fixes common boilerplate problems**  
   - Most boilerplates are **bloated, rigid, or incomplete**.  
   - This thing going to strips unnecessary stuff and keeps only **what you actually need**.  

2. **Designed for you**  
   - Everything is **typed, modular, and scalable**.  
   - Utilities are **pre-analyzed**: only things apps really use.  

3. **Speed = Productivity**  
   - One day of setup now saves **hours or days in every future project**.  
   - Focus on building features, not wiring folders, imports, or state.  

Lets you start coding features **immediately**, without rewriting boilerplate every time.
